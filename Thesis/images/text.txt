Ensure that sensors hardware redundancy are complemented by the time synchronization and intrinsic/extrinsic calibration
Ensure that each element should have a fail-safe and/or fail silent mode, depending on the individual system design aspects
Ensure that redundant elements avoid dependent failure, thus they should be separated by design and avoid common cause failure
Ensure that the system maintains at least degraded capability, even when a single element is not available
